# Asynchronous_Task
This project demonstrates how to implement *asynchronous tasks in Java, with a simple **HTML-based interface* for interaction.  
It showcases how long-running operations can be executed in the background without blocking the main execution thread, improving performance and user experience.

üöÄ Features
- Implementation of *asynchronous task execution* using Java.
- Non-blocking operations with callback/response handling.
- HTML front-end to interact with the Java backend.
- Demonstrates clean separation of *UI* (HTML) and *logic* (Java).
- Easy to extend for real-world scenarios like:
  - File processing  
  - API requests  
  - Background computation
    
üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- *Java* (Core + Concurrency APIs / ExecutorService / CompletableFuture)
- *HTML5* 
- *Servlets / HTTP Handling* 
- *Maven/Gradle*
